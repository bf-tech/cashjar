## Cash Jar - Web App

Cash Jar is based on the Laravel framework and the SB Admin 2 Bootstrap theme.

Cash Jar was developed to provide an ergonomic scalable solution for groups sharing expenses over a google docs/xml spreadsheet.

## Use Cases

### Roommates

This Web App is perfect for students sharing a house where one pays the electric bill the other Internet and a third buys grocery for a party that everybody is supposed to share,
You notice it can go crazy if you have more than four members with each multiple expenses.

### Road-trip adventurers group

Another use case is for a group of people going for a road trip,
A first person pays for the fuel, another one pays for the toll, and a third pays for the hotel and a fourth for dinner.
Using Cash Jar would be the perfect way to know how much you owe each person.

## How Tos?

1. First authenticate, either by logging in if already in the database, or by registering

2. Create a Group-event on the left menu or Join some of the already available Groups

3. Add expenses to the groups you participated in

4. Finally Check how much you owe each individual on the Home page
	* Negative amounts is when you have nothing due and it is that person who owes you
